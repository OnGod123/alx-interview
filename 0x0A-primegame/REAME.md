Dynamic programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique that is particularly useful for optimization problems and problems that involve overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It breaks down a complex problem into simpler subproblems, solves each subproblem once, and stores their solutions, avoiding the need for recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

Key Concepts of Dynamic Programming:
Overlapping Subproblems:

A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems, which are reused multiple times.
Example: In Fibonacci sequence, Fib(5) is calculated by Fib(4) + Fib(3), and Fib(4) is calculated by Fib(3) + Fib(2). You can see that Fib(3) is calculated multiple times.
Optimal Substructure:

A problem has optimal substructure if its optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
Example: In the shortest path problem, if you know the shortest path to a point A and a point B, you can combine them to find the shortest path between them.
Two Approaches in Dynamic Programming:
Top-down approach (Memoization): Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems to avoid recalculating them.
Bottom-up approach (Tabulation): Solve the problem by solving all smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to solve larger problems.
